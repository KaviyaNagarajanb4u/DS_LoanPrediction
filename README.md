Problem Statement
Build and train a model that identifies a customer will repay or default from the loan dataset.

The primary objective is to create a reliable tool that assists the bank in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants, thereby minimizing the risk of default and optimizing lending decisions.


Prediction on Test Dataset
The preprocessing for test dataset is done in the same manner as the train dataset.

The successfully trained tuned model is fitted on the test dataset.

The prediction for ‘loan_status’ is done and saved as a excel file 'loan_status_test'.
